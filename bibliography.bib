Although being a popular technology, several works in the literature have revealed vulnerabilities and risks regarding the security of LoRaWAN v1.0 (the official 1st specification draft). The LoRa-Alliance has built upon these findings and introduced several improvements in the security and architecture of LoRa. The result of these efforts resulted in LoRaWAN v1.1, released on 11 October 2017. This work aims at reviewing and clarifying the security aspects of LoRaWAN v1.1. By following ETSI guidelines, we provide a comprehensive Security Risk Analysis of the protocol and discuss several remedies to the security risks described. A threat catalog is presented, along with discussions and analysis in view of the scale, impact, and likelihood of each threat. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is one of the first of its kind, by providing a detailed security risk analysis related to the latest version of LoRaWAN. Our analysis highlights important practical threats, such as end-device physical capture, rogue gateway and self-replay, which require particular attention by developers and organizations implementing LoRa networks.},

  abstract = {Lately, the software development industry is going through a slow but real transformation. Software is increasingly a part of everything, and, software developers, are trying to cope with this exploding demand through more automation. The pipelining technique of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) has developed considerably due to the overwhelming demand for the deployment and deliverability of new features and applications. As a result, DevOps approaches and Agile principles have been developed, in which developers collaborate closely with infrastructure engineers to guarantee that their applications are deployed quickly and reliably. Thanks to pipeline approach thinking, the efficiency of projects has greatly improved. Agile practices represent the introduction to the system of new features in each sprint delivery. Those practices may contain welldeveloped features or can contain bugs or failures which impact the delivery. The pipeline approach, depicted in this paper, overcomes the problems of delivery, improving the delivery timeline, the test load steps, and the benchmarking tasks. It decreases system interruption by integrating multiple test steps and adds stability and deliverability to the entire process. It provides standardization which means having an established, time-tested process to use, and can also decrease ambiguity and guesswork, guarantee quality and boost productivity. This tool is developed with an interpreted language, namely Bash, which offers an easier method to integrate it into any platform. Based on the experimental results, we demonstrate the value that this solution currently creates. This solution provides an effective and efficient way to generate, manage, customize, and automate Agile-based CI and CD projects through automated pipelines. The suggested system acts as a starting point for standard CI/CD processes, caches Docker layers for subsequent usage, and implements highly available deliverables in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm. Changing the principles of this solution and expanding it into multiple platforms (windows) will be addressed in a future discussion.},

  abstract = {Smart Cities concept increased the number of end devices (ED) which allow the acquisition of parameters for further analysis and processing. The actual technologies based on Internet of Things (IoT) enable sensors connectivity to Internet. This feature allows real time acquisition of several physical data important for smart cities monitoring. In order to minimize the power consumption, Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) assumes an important role on the evolution and growing of wireless network sensors. In this particular type of network, LoRaWAN has taken the lead, among other technologies. Typically most end devices need to be powered with batteries, since they are in remote zones. Therefore one important issue to consider is the global power consumption of the end device building blocks: LoRa transceiver, microcontroller unit and sensor unit. This paper presents the study and simulation results supported on LoRa modulation parameters, in order to estimate the battery lifetime, which is useful for IoT remote sensing units. The achieved results denote it is possible to configure LoRa transceiver with similar parameters and different payloads, reaching the same battery lifetime.},

  abstract = {Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a fast-growing communication system for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) in the Internet of Things (IoTs) deployments. LoRaWAN is built to optimize LPWANs for battery lifetime, capacity, range, and cost. LoRaWAN employs an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme that dynamically optimizes data rate, airtime, and energy consumption. The major challenge in LoRaWAN is that the LoRa specification does not state how the network server must command end nodes pertaining rate adaptation. As a result, numerous ADR schemes have been proposed to cater for the many applications of IoT technology, the quality of service requirements, different metrics, and radio frequency (RF) conditions. This offers a challenge for the reliability and suitability of these schemes. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the research on ADR algorithms for LoRaWAN technology. First, we provide an overview of LoRaWAN network performance that has been explored and documented in the literature and then focus on recent solutions for ADR as an optimization approach to improve throughput, energy efficiency and scalability. We then distinguish the approaches used, highlight their strengths and drawbacks, and provide a comparison of these approaches. Finally, we identify some research gaps and future directions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN technology path loss measurements collected in an indoor office environment, focusing on quantifying the effects of environmental factors on signal propagation. Utilizing a network of six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor gateway (GW) at the University of Siegen's H{\"o}lderlinstra{\ss}e Campus in the City of Siegen, Germany, we systematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various environmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter levels (PM2.5). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena such as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by environmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter signal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of indoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we tested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that integrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental Parameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only Multiple Walls (LDPLSMMW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of environmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides valuable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery life, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, among other applications. The dataset, accessible upon reasonable request, offers a solid foundation for future research and development in indoor wireless communication.},

It facilitates to build multiple virtual machines on a single basic physical machine either in the form of hypervisors or containers. To host many microservice applications, the emergent technology has introduced a model which consists of different operations performed by smaller individual deployed services. Thus, the demand for low-overhead virtualization technique is rapidly developing. There are many lightweight virtualization technologies; docker is one among them, which is an open-source platform. This technology allows developers and system admins to build, create, and run applications using docker engine. This paper provides the performance evaluation of Docker containers and virtual machines using standard benchmark tools such as Sysbench, Phoronix, and Apache benchmark, which include CPU performance, Memory throughput, Storage read/write performance, load test, and operation speed measurement.},

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

  abstract = {Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peerreviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: 1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); 2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; 3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; 4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; 5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and 6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7\%) and evaluation (36.2\%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},

To provide efficient resource sharing and cost effectiveness, such distributed databases typically run concurrently on a virtualized infrastructure that could be implemented using hypervisor-based virtualization or container-based virtualization. Hypervisor-based virtualization is a mature technology but imposes overhead on CPU, networking, and disk. Recently, by sharing the operating system resources and simplifying the deployment of applications, container-based virtualization is getting more popular. This article presents a performance comparison between multiple instances of VMware VMs and Docker containers running concurrently. Our workload models a real-world Big Data Apache Cassandra application from Ericsson. As a baseline, we evaluated the performance of Cassandra when running on the nonvirtualized physical infrastructure. Our study shows that Docker has lower overhead compared with VMware; the performance on the container-based infrastructure was as good as on the nonvirtualized. Our performance evaluations also show that running multiple instances of a Cassandra database concurrently affected the performance of read and write operations differently; for both VMware and Docker, the maximum number of read operations was reduced when we ran several instances concurrently, whereas the maximum number of write operations increased when we ran instances concurrently.},

  abstract = {This paper explains the features and benefits of using continuous delivery, continuous integration (CI/CD). Also investigates impacts of (CD/CI). Continuous delivery(CD) is a set of practices designed to optimize the process of taking changes from version control to production or release to manufacturing. Key elements include comprehensive use of version control, automation of the test and deployment process and the application of continuous integration to rapidly validate the correctness of every change through running the automated build and test process. The goal of Continuous Delivery(CD) is to find ways to deliver highquality, valuable software in an efficient, fast, and reliable manner. Continuous integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of CI are to find and address bugs more quickly, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates. Continuous integration focuses on smaller commits and smaller code changes to integrate. A developer commits code at regular intervals, at minimum once a day. The developer pulls code from the code repository to ensure the code on the local host is merged before pushing to the build server. At this stage the build server runs the various tests and either accepts or rejects the code commit. The basic challenges of implementing CI include more frequent commits to the common codebase, maintaining a single source code repository, automating builds, and automating testing.},

In particular, a low power wearable device for sensing the toxic inflammable gases inside an industrial plant is designed with the purpose of avoiding peculiar risks and unwanted accidents to occur. Moreover, the detected data have to be urgently and reliably delivered to remote server to trigger preventive immediate actions so as to improve the machine operation. In these settings, LoRaWAN has been identified as the most proper communications technology to the needs owing to the availability of off the shelf devices and software. Hence, we assess the technological limits of LoRaWAN in terms of latency and reliability and we propose a fully LoRaWAN compliant solution to overcome these limits. The proposed solution envisages coordinated end device (ED) transmissions through the use of Downlink Control Packets (DCPs). Experimental results validate the proposed method in terms of service requirements for the considered FMAR scenario.},

This study examines the propagation characteristics of 433 MHz LoRa signals in maize fields, focusing on signal attenuation, RSSI, SNR, and packet loss under dense crop conditions. Field experiments were conducted in Wuwei, Gansu Province, with validation tests in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia. The effects of transmitter and receiver antenna heights on signal quality and propagation distance were systematically analyzed. Results show a consistent improvement in signal quality and range with increased antenna height. Path loss models were developed using regression analysis, achieving high predictive accuracy (R2 {$>$} 0.9). Validation confirmed the models' reliability, offering valuable insights for deploying wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in agriculture. Future research will integrate machine learning for dynamic modeling and explore variations across crop growth stages.},

  abstract = {Low Power Wide Area Networks have emerged as a leading communications technology in the field of Internet of Things sensor and monitoring networks. In such networks, uplink traffic is characterized as a combination of periodic data reports and event-triggered alarm reports. When an many devices detect an event in a short timespan, a burst of concurrent transmissions can occur, leading to a surge of collisions, and thus severe data delivery performance degradation. In this paper, a hybrid random/scheduled access strategy is proposed for mitigating the impact of traffic-triggering events on network performance. Under periodic report traffic the LoRaWAN standard Class A protocol is in effect, but after an event a TDMA scheme is applied. Three implementations of this strategy are described. The first is a pair of novel MACs for LoRaWAN, allowing (a) synchronization of end devices with the network using the event detection as a crude synchronization point, and (b) the dynamic scheduling of groups of devices. The other two implementations build upon a single-hop and a two-hop previously proposed LoRaWAN-based wake-up architectures, respectively. The above approaches are validated and studied through extensive simulation. The results show improved packet delivery ratio over the Class A MAC. The effect is more prominent as the event propagation velocity increases. The proposed approach also surpasses LoRaWAN in energy per delivered bit for high event propagation velocities. Finally, the novel protocol has a lower hardware and deployment complexity than the wake up radio based alternatives, at the cost of higher energy consumption.},
